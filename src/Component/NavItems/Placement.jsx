      <p className="mt-6 text-gray-700 text-base lg:text-lg">
        In todayâ€™s changing times, campus placements hold an even greater
        importance for students. Widespread competition and fewer choices make
        it even more difficult to tap the right opportunities. Campus
        placements, therefore, provide the students with a foot-in-the-door,
        enabling them to start off their career right after they have completed
        their course curriculum. Furthermore, they get to interact and engage
        with the industry professionals during the placement drives, which
        further help lay a foundation for their prospective career in the future
        as they familiarise with potential contacts from their chosen career
        field. DSEU campuses over the last 6 months have organised more than 100
        campus placement drives where companies like Maruti, Bajaj Motors, LG,
        Sony, Infosys, Wipro, Deloitte and many others have participated and
        more than 2500 offers were made for placement. DSEU also organised a
        3-day Job Utsav in the month of May where more than 26 companies, 1600
        students participated and 1490 offers were rolled, below mentioned is
        the highlight of the 2021-22 placements.
